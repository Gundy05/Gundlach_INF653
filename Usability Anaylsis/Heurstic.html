		<p id="dude">Heuristic Evaluations</p>
		
		<p><p><span class="dude">The first usability issue involves the image at the top of each website page, which automatically switches to the next image upon navigation.</span> This leads to navigation confusion as users may expect consistency in visual design. The issue occurs in the website header section across all pages. It violates the heuristic principle of "Consistency and Standards" since users anticipate a static header or predictable navigation elements, as well as "Recognition Rather Than Recall," because the shifting image forces users to reassess their location instead of reinforcing familiar navigation cues. The severity of this issue is moderate, as it does not directly block functionality but impacts user orientation.</p>

<p><p><span class="dude">The second usability problem is the absence of a mini map on the About page.</span> This mini map would serve as an additional element to provide users with more context about the clinic's location. Its absence violates the heuristic principle of "Match Between System and Real World," as users expect a physical representation of location to better understand where the clinic is, as well as "Help and Documentation," since maps offer immediate location context without requiring extra clicks. The severity of this issue is minorâ€”it does not hinder usability but reduces accessibility to location-related information.</p>

<p><p><span class="dude">The third issue pertains to booking functionality. Clicking "Book Now" redirects users to an entirely different site</span>, opening a new tab instead of allowing users to complete booking within the same website. This violates the heuristics of "Flexibility and Efficiency of Use," since users may not expect or appreciate being taken to a different tab, and "Consistency and Standards," because navigating to a separate site disrupts cohesion between website elements. The severity of this issue is major, as the redirect increases friction in the booking process and may cause users to abandon booking altogether.</p>

<p><p><span class="dude">The fourth usability issue is the organization of the Contact page.</span> Currently, the form appears at the bottom, while basic contact details such as phone number, email, and address are at the top. Users typically expect the contact form to be readily accessible, rather than needing to scroll to find it. This violates the heuristic principle of "User Control and Freedom," as users might want immediate access to the form rather than searching for it, as well as "Visibility of System Status," since contact details are essential but receive prominence over the actionable form. The severity of this issue is moderate, as all necessary information is present but the layout diminishes efficiency.</p>

<p><p><span class="dude">The final usability problem is incomplete pricing information on the booking site.</span> Only a few services display pricing, leading to inconsistencies and requiring users to search or inquire about missing prices. This violates the heuristic principle of "Consistency and Standards," as users expect uniform pricing across services, as well as "Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors," since missing pricing information creates uncertainty. The severity of this issue is major, as lack of transparency can deter users from booking services.</p>
