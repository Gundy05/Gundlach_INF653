		<h2>Self Reflection</h2>
		
		<p>The process of analyzing and evaluating the chiropractic website has been an insightful journey, providing a deeper understanding of usability principles and user experience design. From identifying key usability issues to conducting heuristic evaluations, this project reinforced the importance of intuitive navigation, clear information, and accessibility. By closely examining how users interact with the website, I have developed a greater appreciation for the complexities involved in creating an effective and user-friendly interface.</p>

<p>One of the most valuable aspects of this project was gathering user feedback through interviews and usability testing. Learning from real users provided a practical perspective on design elements that may not have been immediately apparent. For example, the confusion caused by the rotating header image and the difficulty in accessing contact information were issues that surfaced through direct engagement. These findings emphasized the importance of designing with user behavior in mind rather than relying solely on theoretical best practices.</p>

<p>Additionally, reflecting on the improvements suggested throughout this evaluation helped clarify how minor changes can significantly enhance the overall experience. Whether it was restructuring the contact page, improving booking functionality, or ensuring consistency in service pricing, each change contributed to a more cohesive and effective website. The project reaffirmed that great design is not just about aesthetics but about creating a seamless and intuitive journey for the user.</p>

<p>Overall, this project has strengthened my ability to think critically about web usability and user-centered design. It has highlighted the importance of iterative improvements and the need for continuous evaluation to refine digital experiences. Moving forward, I will carry these insights into future projects, ensuring that websites not only look good but function in a way that truly serves their users.</p>
