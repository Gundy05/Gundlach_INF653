		<h2>User Findings</h2>
		
		<div class="container">
		
		<p><span class="dude">User One Findings:</span> User one had an overall positive experience with the website, rating Task 1 with a 5 for ease of navigation and information clarity. However, Task 2 received a 4 because the fastest communication method wasn't clearly highlighted, making contact slightly less intuitive. Task 3 also scored a 4, as the booking site contained autoscroll links that, when navigating too far down, caused the navigation bar to disappear, requiring manual scrolling. Navigation received a 4, and information clarity was rated a perfect 5, with the user complimenting the clear layout, comfortable aesthetic, and well-chosen color scheme. The homepage stood out as a favorite due to its useful and accessible information, but the contact page was noted as a weak point for its confusing layout. Despite these minor drawbacks, user one would recommend the site, suggesting that some images could better align with relevant pages.</p>

<p><span class="dude">User Two Findings:</span> User two had a seamless experience, awarding 5s across all categories, including navigation, task completion, and overall site usability. They found the site highly informative and appreciated its direct approach in delivering essential information. They had no recommendations for improvement or noted dislikes, emphasizing that the website was functional and well-structured. With a strong impression of the site's clarity, user two would recommend it to others, particularly for its concise yet comprehensive presentation of chiropractic services.</p>

<p><span class="dude">User Three Findings:</span> User three also gave perfect 5s across all ratings but did identify a few areas for enhancement. They suggested restructuring the contact page to improve accessibility and noted that pricing inconsistencies on the booking site could be refined. Additionally, they recommended replacing the scrolling photo feature with static images per page to maintain consistency. Their least favorite aspect of the site was that booking took place on an external site, which felt disconnected from the main experience. However, what they most appreciated was the personal feel of the website compared to other chiropractic clinics, which made it more engaging and trustworthy.</p>
